# Research Notes

Separates the **research** (open, unsolved) from the **engineering** (built,
working) in the NSM Consciousness Transformer, and records the design decisions.

## The research-vs-engineering boundary

**Engineered and working** — the stateful loop and its scaffolding:
- The state-transition step, three heads (transition / action repertoire /
  response), the `Mind` unroll, two-tier read/write memory, the loss, metrics,
  config, tokenizer, the curriculum generator, the bAbI loader, and the NSM
  prime constants. With **no action supervision**, the model chooses
  absorb/append/respond/skip per item and learns *when* to answer purely from
  answer correctness (~90% held-out, including the corrupting-distractor level).

**Mocked / placeholder / stubbed** — the actual research lives here:
- What the **consciousness state means** and its real objective (abstract +
  placeholder consistency loss).
- **Semantic composition** onto NSM primes (`MockSemanticMapper`).
- A **consistent parser** (the rule parser is experimental; wrapped optionally).
- **Cross-episode credit assignment** for the APPEND action (uses a novelty aux).
- **Textbook ingestion** (`TextbookSource` is a stub — the north star).

## Open problems

### 0. Emergent actions and trust: built, with honest caveats
The action repertoire {ABSORB, APPEND, RESPOND, SKIP} and a **trust** signal are
**not** supervised — all shaped only by the answer loss. The answer is a
RESPOND-probability-weighted aggregate (so "when to respond" emerges); trust
scales how strongly each item is written to memory (so "whom to trust" emerges,
because answering corroboration episodes correctly requires discounting the
contradiction). Open issues:
- **Trust is modestly leveraged.** `trust_gap > 0` (it trusts corroborated items
  more), but the signal is small: the task can also be solved inside the response
  head, so nothing *forces* trust to carry the load. Making trust the necessary
  mechanism (e.g. a bottleneck, or an explicit contradiction-detection objective)
  is open. Distinguishing **contradiction from temporal update** ("moved to")
  is also unsolved — both look like a memory conflict.
- **APPEND** still only pays off in *future* episodes, so it has no within-episode
  answer gradient; it is now gated by trust × its action prob, which is a sensible
  proxy but not real **cross-episode credit assignment** (RL / a value over future
  retrieval). Symptom: the model still APPENDs novel *questions* as "world facts".
- **Forgetting/decay**: trust should let contradicted info *decay* out of
  long-term memory, giving the FIFO pruning placeholder a real policy. Unbuilt.
- **Response timing is under-determined** on easy episodes (one fact answers the
  question); `mean_respond_position` is a neutral diagnostic, not a target.

### 0b. The self-controlled read / think / respond loop (next step)
Today the loop iterates once per item with a fixed number of internal reasoning
passes (`reasoning_hops`), and a response is always aggregated. The intended
architecture lets **the model control its own loop**: each tick it chooses to
**read** the next input, **think** internally (reason over memory without new
input), or **respond** — so not every input needs a response and it can process
and *wait*. The differentiable approximation here (per-item processing + sparse
soft response + fixed think steps) is a stand-in; true learned control over
read/think/respond is a discrete-control / RL problem and is the next rung. The
WSD coherence head and a confidence/halting signal are the natural trigger for
"I'm ready to answer now."

### 1. What is the consciousness state? (and its real loss)
The state is deliberately **abstract** — a learned vector with no imposed meaning
("figure it out later"). The auxiliary `consciousness_consistency_loss` is a
placeholder (L2 between consecutive states, a "don't thrash" prior); note it
*rises* as the model learns, because encoding facts legitimately moves the state.
Open: define what the state should represent (self-model? working-memory
summary? confidence/awareness?) and an objective that rewards *coherent* state
evolution rather than mere stability. `TODO(consciousness-loss)` in `losses.py`.

### 2. Semantic composition onto NSM primes
Still the central unsolved problem and explicitly out of scope. `MockSemanticMapper`
carries no meaning. NAOMI already has a *designed but unbuilt* geometric encoder
(`quantum_parser`'s `compose_subtree`: parse tree → vector via edge-type
operators). Open: how meaning is represented over the ~65 NSM primes, how
composition (negation/quantifiers/scope) works, and how it is supervised.

**WSD is a tractable first slice of this** (`wsd.py`). Instead of composing
meaning, it picks among a *finite* candidate set (each sense an NSM-prime
signature), disambiguating with a memory/state context. It is **coherence-driven
and self-correcting**: a learned coherence head asks "does this interpretation
make sense given the state?"; if not, the state updates and all senses are
re-evaluated (the chosen sense can flip across hops). No gold sense labels — the
coherence signal drives it. Currently the inventory and the sense→prime
signatures are **mocked** (`MockSenseInventory`); the real inventory is WordNet
(`WordNetSenseInventory` hook, which is itself this same mapping problem). Open
next: real WordNet senses, learning the coherence signal from self-supervised
"surprise"/contradiction rather than synthetic labels, and **wiring WSD into the
Mind loop** so sense-resolved representations (not raw tokens) are what get
written to memory.

### 2b. Multi-hop reasoning and adaptive halting
`agent.Mind` now supports fixed `reasoning_hops` passes over memory at the
question ("reason with states"). Open: make halting **adaptive** (ACT-style) —
stop reasoning when a coherence/confidence signal says the answer is settled,
rather than a fixed hop count. The WSD coherence head is the prototype for that
signal; unifying the two (one coherence mechanism for both WSD re-evaluation and
reasoning-loop halting) is the interesting direction.

### 3. Input encoding: the parser is experimental → "chained transformers"
The rule-based parser is inconsistent, so it is **not** the spine — the default
input encoder is plain tokenization, and `ParserInputEncoder` wraps the parser
optionally (degrading to tokens on any failure). The user's fallback if natural
language proves too messy is **chained transformers**: a learned encoder that
maps a sentence to the input object, implementing the same `AbstractInputEncoder`
interface. Not built; the seam is ready.

### 4. Memory: two tiers built; pruning + consolidation still open
There are now **two tiers**: per-episode `WorkingMemory` (local context) and a
persistent `LongTermMemory` that accumulates a growing repo of entries +
connections across episodes (`lifelong.py` grows it). The state controls
retention via a `consolidate_gate`. Still open:
- **Pruning/forgetting** is a placeholder FIFO cap (`_maybe_prune`); a real
  policy should weigh connection strength, recency, and redundancy.
- The **connection graph** is simplistic (entries from one episode are linked);
  real associative structure (typed relations, co-retrieval, inferred links)
  is unbuilt — this is where the "giant repo of connections" should become a
  genuine knowledge graph (and connects to NAOMI's WordNet/triple work).
- Long-term contents are **non-parametric** (detached vectors); retrieval read
  projections are learned but the store is a database, not weights. Whether/when
  to distill the repo back into parameters is open.
- Working-memory writes are soft slots at a fixed index; content-addressed
  allocation is future work.

### 5. Tree serialization (flat → hierarchical)
`serialize_parse_tree` now includes semantic-role relations but is still a flat
pre-order stream; hierarchy is not recoverable. Open: structural position
encodings / tree-aware or graph encoders. `TODO(tree-encoding)`.

### 6. Consciousness-dimension ablation
`consciousness_dim` is a free knob and the state is opaque. Open: ablate it
(8/48/128/512) against accuracy and state-transition stability; does capacity
help or just drift?

### 7. Coherence checking
Nothing verifies the answer is consistent with the stored facts / state. Open: a
coherence objective or verifier (closely related to problem 1), and
contradiction detection over the `CausalTable` / memory.

### 8. The textbook north star
The goal is to **read a textbook chapter as the context stream and answer its
(often multiple-choice) homework questions**. `TextbookSource` is a stub. Open:
chapter → clean context stream segmentation, and homework-question extraction →
`Episode`. Multiple choice is kept first-class precisely because it gives the
densest training signal ("most training up").

### 9. Reconciling NSM primes with NAOMI's 51 anchor dimensions
NAOMI's existing semantic space uses 51 linguistically-motivated anchors
(nominals/scopes/roles + grammatical + logical); this module uses the ~65 NSM
primes. They are conceptually adjacent but distinct, and nobody has decided which
(or how) is the basis. Open question, not yet addressed.

## Decisions made while building

- **Transformer as a state-transition function, not a text model.** NAOMI's
  existing thesis is explicitly anti-transformer-for-reasoning; here the
  transformer is the *transition operator* inside a loop, and the reasoning is
  carried by the persistent state + external memory.
- **Episodes expand into a per-sentence unroll**, padded to a max context length
  with a step mask; the question is a distinct aligned final step for every
  episode (clean batching).
- **Memory writes are gated by the ABSORB action probability** and threaded
  through the unroll as state (not stored on the module) for clean autograd.
- **Multiple choice kept as first-class** (densest signal) and reuses v1's option
  scoring; open-ended (bAbI) supported via an answer-vocab classifier.
- **Weak action supervision** (statements→ABSORB, question→RESPOND) teaches the
  procedure; it converges to 100% action accuracy quickly.
- **Parser demoted to an optional input encoder** given its inconsistency; the
  default path has zero parser dependency so install/tests stay light.
- **Deterministic data sources**; bAbI degrades gracefully to the curriculum
  generator when the download is blocked.

## NSM prime inventory — caveats
`nsm_primes.py` follows the canonical ~65-prime table (Goddard & Wierzbicka 2014)
to the best of our knowledge. Version-dependent details are flagged
`TODO(canonical-list)` (e.g. whether `DON'T WANT` is a distinct prime, the
possession prime's exact form `(IS) MINE` vs. `HAVE`, the allolex set). These
should be verified against a primary source; nothing was fabricated to fill gaps.
