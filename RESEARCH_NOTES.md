### M58g RESOLVED — default parse cap hoisted; train_prose hang gone (2026-09-02)

Fix landed (8662172): quantum_parser/src/parser/data_structures.py:249
ParserConfig.max_parse_seconds default None -> 30.0. Every parse() call is
now bounded even when a caller forgets an explicit override; override still
available via config_override. eval_prose.py build_one already had a broad
`except Exception` so it drops the now-raised ParseResourceExceeded and
continues — no caller edit needed. VERIFY: tests/ suite 77 passed (no
regression from the cap); quantum_parser 63f/60p/11e are PRE-EXISTING
(identical with fix stashed out, all DSL grammar-load errors, unrelated).
PROOF: train_prose smoke (2 epochs) completed in 4.24 min instead of
hanging — 10s batch cap fired, per-episode probe dropped 5/42 culprits,
training proceeded and saved prose_smoke.pt. This closes the parser-hang
saga (3 uncapped call sites -> one default bound at the parser). Full
20-epoch prose-training run (the M58 payoff) re-fired on top of this.
